# Blazor Article template websites

The repository includes two template projects that demonstrate how to use the BlazorArticle library with examples of article rendering.
You can use them as a base to freely develop your own projects.

One project is a Blazor Web App that renders articles on the server side, and the other is a Blazor WebAssembly Standalone application that renders articles on the client side.

See the repository of **BlazorArticle library** [here](https://github.com/witM/BlazorArticle).
